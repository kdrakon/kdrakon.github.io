        I bought a watch in 2023: the <b>Seiko Grand Quartz 9943-8000</b>. I had become so enamored with it after reading this <a
            href="https://adventuresinamateurwatchfettling.com/2021/09/26/twin-quartz-a-seiko-grand-quartz-9943-8000-from-june-1978/">blog post</a> (which I
        highly recommend reading). To quickly summarise, I love this watch because of:
        <ol>
            <li>its highly accurate <em>twin quartz</em> movement</li>
            <li>the history of said movement, which was groundbreaking engineering at the time, and</li>
            <li>its good looks!</li>
        </ol>

        The watch is even considered a part of <b>Grand Seiko's</b> own history in <a
            href="https://www.grand-seiko.com/in-en/special/10stories/vol4/1">Vol.4 of "A history of Grand Seiko in ten chapters."</a>

            I found my watch on eBay in March. I had been combing listings try to find a good price; you could either pay a lot—upwards of $1000 AUD—for something in mint or slightly mint condition, or pay as little as $200-$500 AUD in an auction for something very much used or aged. We are talking about something more than 40 years old, so the used instances were not always in the best condition.
        </p>

        <p>
            Eventually I settled on someone selling a watch from Sydney. It <em>mostly</em> looked good, but I have to admit, I may have been a bit
            <em>too</em> excited to get one after having looked for so long.

            The band wasn't the original, but other than some wear and tear, it looked good. The patina looked great in my opinion. I did confirm the colour of the watch was two-toned (mistake #1).
