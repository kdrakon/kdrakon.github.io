                    Yup, I am a software developer. I primarily work with Java and Scala, but I'm a firm believer in polyglot programming and love to learn about new languages, libraries, and tools. I like to tinker around with frontend development, but I'm a backend/platform developer at heart. I jump at the chance (and challenge) of building software systems and services &mdash; especially Web applications &mdash; meant to handle floods of users and data.<p>
                    
                    Lately, I've been playing with things such as <a href="http://akka.io">Akka</a>, <a href="http://spray.io">Spray</a>, and <a href="http://www.playframework.com/">Play</a> to create distributed, concurrent, and fault-tolerant systems. I've also taken the initiative to get acquainted with a multitude of frameworks and libraries in the JavaScript world.

                    <h3>Some stuff I do and some stuff I did</h3>
                    Currently, I'm a Platform Software Engineer at <a href="http://bibliocommons.com">BiblioCommons</a>. I do stuff with Java &mdash; mainly building and maintaining Web applications and Servlet-based software (deployed mainly in Tomcat) &mdash; with a mix of other stuff (Gradle, Hibernate, Spring, Google Guice and Guava, Ehcache, Memcached, ActiveMQ, Jersey, RestEasy, a scattering of Apache libraries, <i>and the list goes on</i>...). I also occasionally do some stuff with Ruby on Rails, JRuby, and JavaScript.<p>
                    
                    Before this, I was a postdoc at the National University of Ireland, Galway where I did stuff with Java (Hadoop, <a href="https://mahout.apache.org/">Mahout</a>, <a href="https://storm.incubator.apache.org/">Storm</a>, Jetty, <a href="http://www.openrdf.org/">OpenRDF</a>), JavaScript (Node.js, Backbone.js, JQuery, Three.js), SPARQL, and HTML. There was also a sprinkle of Python here and there.<p>
                    
                    And before that, I studied and researched applications of logic programming &mdash; specifically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming">answer set programming</a> &mdash; in conjunction with theories in access control and information security (in particular with XML documents).<p>

                    <h3>Some other stuff about me, in brevity</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I've been playing around with computers since the beginning of the 90's and have been programming for more than 15 years.
                        <li>I hava a <i>Diploma in Software Engineering</i>, a <i>Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science</i>, and an <i>Honours</i> and <i>PhD</i> in the same field. I studied in Canada (my home and native land) and in Australia.
                        <li>Besides living in Australia for ~6 years, I also lived in Ireland for one year and did some postdoctoral work at the <i>National University of Ireland, Galway</i>. Presently, I'm back home in Ontario, Canada.
                        <li>Outside of computer science, software, programming, and the vast wealth of information that the Internet and social media beckon me with (i.e. Reddit &amp; Twitter), I also enjoy listening to music, (re)watching a ton of movies, and playing video games (when I can find the time). When I'm not in front of a screen, you'll find me spending time with my wife and family in the <i>real world</i>.
