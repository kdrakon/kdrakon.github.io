                Yup, I am a software developer. I primarily work with Scala and Java, but I'm a firm believer in polyglot programming and love to learn about new languages, libraries, and tools. I sometimes tinker around with frontend development, but I'm a backend/platform developer at heart. I jump at the chance (and challenge) of building software systems and services &mdash; especially Web applications &mdash; meant to handle floods of users and data.<p>

                <h3>Some stuff I do and some stuff I did</h3>
                Currently, I am a Principal Consultant at <a href="http://simplemachines.com.au">Simple Machines</a>. As a consultant and software engineer, I work with and utilise the best technologies that will help clients solve the problems they present to us. I mainly do cool and fun stuff with Scala and it's multitude of open-source libraries and frameworks. Almost everything we build is cloud-based using platforms like Amazon Web Services and environments like Docker. And in a world of big and streaming data, we also utilise platforms like Kafka as backbones for our fault-tolerant and distributed applications.<p>

                Previously, I was a Platform Software Engineer at <a href="http://bibliocommons.com">BiblioCommons</a>. I did stuff with Java &mdash; mainly building and maintaining Web applications and Servlet-based software (deployed mainly in Tomcat) &mdash; with a mix of other stuff (Gradle, Hibernate, Spring (DI, MVC), Google Guice and Guava, Ehcache, Memcached, ActiveMQ, Jersey, RestEasy, Hystrix, RxJava, a scattering of Apache libraries, <i>and the list goes on</i>...). I also occasionally did some stuff with Ruby on Rails, JRuby, and JavaScript.<p>

                Before that, I was a postdoc at the <a href="http://www.nuigalway.ie/">National University of Ireland</a>, Galway where I did stuff with Java (Hadoop, Mahout, Storm, Jetty, OpenRDF), JavaScript (Node.js, Backbone.js, JQuery, Three.js), SPARQL, and HTML. There was also a sprinkle of Python here and there.<p>

                And before that, I studied and researched applications of logic programming &mdash; specifically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming">answer set programming</a> &mdash; in conjunction with theories in access control and information security (in particular with XML documents).<p>

                <h3>Some other stuff about me, in brevity</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I've been playing around with computers since the beginning of the 90's and have been programming for more than 15 years.
                    <li>I hava a <i>Diploma in Software Engineering</i>, a <i>Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science</i>, and an <i>Honours</i> and <i>PhD</i> in the same field. I studied in Canada (my home and native land) and in Australia.
                    <li>Before moving permanently to Australia in 2016, I also lived in Ireland and did some postdoctoral work at the <i>National University of Ireland, Galway</i>. I'm originally from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, and first moved to Australia temporarily in 2006.
                    <li>Outside of computer science, software, programming, and the vast wealth of information that the Internet and social media beckon me with (i.e. Reddit &amp; Twitter), I also enjoy listening to music, (re)watching a ton of movies, and playing video games (when I can find the time). When I'm not in front of a screen, you'll find me spending time with my wife and family in the <i>real world</i>.
                </ul>
