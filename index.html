            Yup, I am a software developer. I'm a firm believer in polyglot programming and love to learn about new
            languages, libraries, frameworks, etc.. I jump at the chance (and challenge) of building software systems,
            services, and tools.

        <p>
            The following are the languages and technologies I'm enjoying developing with the most right now:

                    <li>Web and distributed applications with Scala and/or Java</li>
                    <li>System tools and native applications&mdash;especially on smaller footprint computers&mdash;using Rust</li>
                    <li>Apache Kafka, especially Kafka Streams</li>
                    <li>Containerisation, primarily with Docker</li>
                    <li>Amazon Web Services (AWS), like EC2 and ECS</li>

        <h3>Some stuff I do and some stuff I did</h3>

        <p class="opening">
            Currently, I am a lead software engineer at <a href="https://limepay.com.au">Limepay</a>. Born out of the "buy-now-pay-later" boom,
            Limepay evolved as a fintech to become more than just another "BNPL". We are building things using Scala, zio, cats, http4s, tapir/sttp,
            and Google Cloud Platform, just to name a few.
        <p>
            In 2019, I was a Senior Backend Developer at <a href="https://clearscore.com.au">ClearScore</a>. Although it was an already
            established company overseas, I was part of the team that was tasked with bringing their product to Australia in 2020. We built
            a bunch of services in Scala using things like http4s, cats, Monix, and doobie.
        <p>
            Previously, I was a Principal Consultant at <a href="https://simplemachines.com.au">Simple Machines</a>. As a
            consultant and software developer, I worked with and utilised the best technologies that will helped clients solve
            the problems they presented to us. The majority of those solutions involved Scala, Apache Kafka, and the use of AWS resources.
        <p>
            Prior to this, I was a Platform Software Engineer at <a href="https://bibliocommons.com">BiblioCommons</a>. I
            did stuff with Java &mdash; mainly building and maintaining a SaaS, Web applications, and Servlet-based
            software with a mix of other Java-ish stuff.
        <p>
            I also worked at DoublePlay adapting the backend system of their mobile application to
            handle a much higher throughput of users and interactions. I designed and built the entire system using
            Scala and Akka.
        <p>
            Before that, I was a postdoc at the <a href="https://www.nuigalway.ie/">National University of Ireland</a>,
            Galway where I also did stuff with Java (Hadoop, Mahout, Storm, Jetty, OpenRDF).
        <p>
            And before that, I studied and researched applications of logic programming &mdash; specifically <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming">answer set programming</a> &mdash; in
            conjunction with theories in access control and information security (in particular with XML documents).

        <h3>Some other stuff about me</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I've been playing around with computers since the beginning of the 90's and have been programming for
                more than 15 years.
            <li>I hava a <b>Diploma in Software Engineering</b>, a <b>Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science</b>, and an
                <b>Honours</b> and <b>PhD</b> in the same field. I studied in Canada (my home and native land) and in
                Australia.
            <li>Before moving permanently to <b>Australia</b> in 2016, I also lived in <b>Ireland</b> and did some postdoctoral work
                at the <i>National University of Ireland, Galway</i>. I'm originally from <b>Hamilton, Ontario, Canada</b>, and
                first moved to Australia temporarily in 2006.
            <li>Outside of computer science, software, programming, and the vast wealth of information that the Internet
                and social media beckon me with (i.e. Reddit &amp; Twitter), I also enjoy listening to music,
                (re)watching a ton of movies, and playing video games (when I can find the time). When I'm not in front
                of a screen, you'll find me spending time with my wife and family in the <i>real world</i>.
